# AI Interview Coach

Mobile app to practice interviews: setup → questions → interview → results, plus a paywall flow.

## Tech
- Expo / React Native

## Setup
1) Install:
    npm install
2) Run:
    npx expo start

## Notes
- Keep API keys in `.env` (don’t commit it).
- `ai-interview-server/` currently appears as a submodule if it has its own `.git`.
